# GA Project 1: **Mastermind**
## Game Overview
Mastermind is a code breaking board game invented in 1970. The goal of this game is to crack a secret code, usually set by the other player. My version of the game sees the user battle the mighty computer, who is in charge of setting the secret code.

### Game Rules 
A secret 4-color code has been set. It is your job to crack the code. To start the game, you must enter a code submission. To do this, you click on the colors in the color selector grid. The order in which you click the colors is the order in which they appear on the grid (going from left to right). 

If you are happy with your color code, simply press the "Submit Code" button to recieve your clues.  Clues will appear on 4 smaller cells (Pegs) adjacent to your code. They come in 2 varieties:

    1. Black Pegs:  These pegs indicate that one of your guesses is correct both in color and position.

    2. Red Pegs: These pegs indicate that one of your guesses is correct but in the incorrect position.

If you wish to change your code attempt (before submission), simply press the clear button to clear. This will clear the current row and allow you to try again. 

Once you have cracked the code, the secret code will appear at the top of the board. 

Good luck.
